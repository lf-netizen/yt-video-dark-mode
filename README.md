<h1 align="center">YouTube Video Dark Mode</h1>

A simple extension designed to invert colors on a youtube video. Useful to reduce eye strain when the video shows a website or *(I look at you, Jupyter Notebooks users)* a light-themed code editor. Works in Chrome.

Yeah, it inverts colors on everything. It was meant to be ready-to-use as soon as possible and there are no quick fixes to that. Hope it doesn't bother you.
